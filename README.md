# A stupid project tool

## Some basic requirements
- instance details
- network credentials
- database credentials
- API credentials
- Project Repos

## Integrations for greater visibility and faster updates
- git integration
- redmine inegration

## Extras if possible
- dev chat
- forums


## Tech primarily
- go for backend services
- web is the front end (no JS framework is decided)
- microservices architecture ( for modularity and flexibility in maintaining it )
- primarily MySQL , not a permanent one for now.


## TLDR
- don't expect much, even I don't know what I am doing.
